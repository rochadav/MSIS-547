                <p>  In the summer of 2023, I was honored to showcase our groundbreaking research at the Venturewell Pioneer Stage 1 event in the historic city of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Working in collaboration with my esteemed colleague Kevin Lomax from Central Washington University, we embarked on a mission to revolutionize the smartphone industry by focusing on the pivotal themes of sustainability and repairability. Our innovative approach is characterized by the strategic omission of adhesives within our device assembly. This decision is rooted in a simple yet profound understanding: the use of adhesives creates barriers to efficient repair, unnecessarily complicating the disassembly process and, as a consequence, shortening the device's usable life. 

                    Adhesives, while commonly used to seal components, ultimately undermine the device's long-term durability. Once a device is opened and the adhesive bond is broken, the smartphone's inherent resistance to the elements, specifically water and particulate matter, is significantly diminished. This not only impacts functionality but also contributes to the growing problem of electronic waste as consumers are compelled to replace their devices more frequently.
                    
                    In response to these industry-wide challenges, our project proposes a radical redesign of the smartphone's internal architecture. We have integrated a precision-engineered gasket system coupled with an innovative locking mechanism, which together offer a seamless yet robust assembly. This modular approach not only facilitates easier repair but also empowers users to upgrade components as needed, effectively decelerating the cycle of obsolescence.
                    
                    Our vision is one where smartphones are not just mere commodities but are durable, lasting companions. The introduction of this pioneering design strategy marks a step towards extending the lifespan of our personal electronics. Our dual objectives are clear: to enhance the consumer experience by offering a product that endures and to mitigate the environmental toll by diminishing the volume of e-waste.
